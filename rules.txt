I want to simulate a market. Is this a good overview?

- Individuals have a position they're at and money
- Individuals want to optimize quality or price of what they buy depending on how much money they have
- Individuals "work" at companies to earn money
- Individuals have an education level between 0 and 1 where companies that produce products of higher quality need more educated workers
- More educated individuals have a higher wage than less educated individuals
- Some individuals will "spawn" near population centers
- Individuals will prioritize buying from local companies and then look more globally (even if a global company might fit them somewhat, they will prioritize buying from a local one even if it's a slightly worse fit)

- Companies can have an influence level between 0 and 1 where 1 can interact with every individual on the map while 0 only can interact with individuals that are 1 space away from them.
- The influence level is dependent on "revenue" compared to the average inside their own reach
- Companies can trade with each other and their product has a single value for quality and price
- Companies want to optimize economic growth, a high-quality product costs more to produce for them
- If a company has a higher education level among workers on average, they can produce higher quality products for a low price
- Quality and price are dynamic

- There's a 0% tax for now

Should competition, differentiation and potentially monopoly emerge naturally?
